Advanced Numerical Methods for Compressible Flows | Prof. J. C. Mandal, IIT Bombay
• Solved Roe’s scheme for moving grids and Euler equation with ALE method for 1-D shock tube problem in FVM
• Performed dynamic meshing to track the contact wave using inverse distance spring analogy in Python
• Developed a methodology for moving grid simulations whilst experiencing inevitable distortions in the flow fields
